    "I've been a fan of Radiolab ever since I was a college freshman, when I was assigned to listen to [\"Musical Language.\"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/91512-musical-language) It was my first introduction to the medium, and the thoughtfulness of this episode's composition really left a mark on me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiolab has evolved a great deal over time, shifting from science and technology to more culture/politics. Moreover, older episodes continue to be trimmed from podcast apps, making it difficult and inconvenient to listen to my favorite old episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to build a quick scraper of the wnycstudios website to download the complete archive of Radiolab episodes, which I can then listen to via my Plex Pass app."
