    "I have been a long time fan of Radiolab ever since first hearing [\"Musical Language\"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/91512-musical-language) for an undergraduate ethnomusicology class. Over time, the program has shifted away from the science/technology topics which originally drew me to it. Moreover, older episodes continue to be dropped from common podcast apps. As a result, it has become difficult to access older material in a convenient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a workaround, I decided to create a quick scraper of the wnycstudios website, which hosts Radiolab's entire archive of episodes. This scraper, demonstrated below, programmatically downloads this archive, which can then be stored either onto a mobile device or personal streaming service (such as Plex)."
